# Data Structures Repository -- CH4NGE

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to provide clear, efficient, and well-documented examples of common data structures for educational and reference purposes.

## Current Implementations

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a data field and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations.

Key features of our Linked List implementation:
- Append: Add a new node to the end of the list
- Prepend: Add a new node to the beginning of the list
- Delete: Remove a node with a specific value from the list
- Display: Print all elements in the list

## Usage

To use any of the data structures, simply import the relevant class and create a new instance. For example, to use the Linked List:
